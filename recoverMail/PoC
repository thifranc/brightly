If you go to the recover password page and inspect it you will see a mail.
You can now easily change the mail adress and put yours.
Why is it a problem ?:
The website don't check your identity so for exemple if the website juste ask for the login I can easily pretend to be a random user and get his password.
How to fix it?:
Dont put the mail adress in the html.
