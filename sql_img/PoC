While searching table and column in the search member field you saw the list_images table.
This table conntain columns like:
- url
- title
- comment

But if you try to access to this table an error occured because it's not the good scheme. These sql injections can only be done in the search img url.

How to prevent it ?
in many languages functions to prevent sql injection exist. For exemple in php you can use the mysql_real_escape_string() function.
it will escape characters like: NULL, \n, \r , ',' and other.
