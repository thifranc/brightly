Possible exploit:
That is more to prevent the fact that some headers can be changed and your website should test them, for example HTTP verb tampering can be a type of attack where you change your HTTP verb and the website lets you in.

for example if and htaccess file looks like this :
		<Limit GET>
		Deny from all
		</Limit>
You can bypass this restriction by faking your HTTP verb

How to prevent this :
Be aware of it and be a decent coder 😉
