from: http://10.11.200.246/index.php?page=survey

You see onchange="javascript:this.form.submit();"
You look networks on Inspector
You curl and change param

You got flag

When you go to the survey page you can note Subjects by selecting a value in the dropdown. The range of value is between 1 and 9.
But we can change it by doint a curl request. If you inspect the page you will see that there is a onChange request. Go to network and copy the request as curl
Change the value and put a number above 9. The server accepted the request without checking the value of value. You got the flag.

How to fix it?:
You need to check if the value is between 1 and 9.
