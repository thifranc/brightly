When you try to type something in the input an SQL error appears. Now we know that we can put SQl here and make an SQL injection.
Search How to show tables with an SQl Injection in google to have the right sql line.
You will find something like this: 1 UNION SELECT table_name, 1 FROM information_schema.tables
It shows all the tables, and when you scroll down, at the bottom of the page you see the table user.
Now that you have the table you want to know what columns this table have so you put an other SQL to find the columns.
1 union SELECT COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
You see that users have multiple columns, but for this just three are important.
- countersign
- first_name
- commentaire

first print first_name and counter sign
1 union select first_name, countersign from users

now as you can see a First name named Flag have for surname a flag. But it's not finish if you replace countersign by commentaire you will see the steps that you need to follow to convert this flag into a real flag.

How to prevent it ?:

in many languages functions to prevent sql injection exist. For exemple in php you can use the mysql_real_escape_string() function.
it will escape characters like: NULL, \n, \r , ',' and other.
