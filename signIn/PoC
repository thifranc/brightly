When you search in the sql db you will find member_brute_force. So you can deducte that you will need to brutforce the login page.
To brutforce a password you need to try the most used password.They are multiple files in internet who regroup them, one of the most famous is rockyou.txt.
The login method is in GET so you can juste make a script who will make a lot of request trying the password one by one.
We decided to try two username for the login, the first one was root, because we found it in the htpaswd and the other one was admin, because we had a cookie named i_am_admin.

How to fix it:
You can easily put a captcha like the google captcha. And prefer a post method instead of a get.
