You want to know what stored by the site, like you never know you know
You see in cookies:
I_am_admin

You got some string
Hmmm, looks like and MD5 to me, let's try and decrypt it :
	Md5(false) = 68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327
Yes ! it says "false"
You encrypt true in MD5 and set your cookie to this value :
	Md5(true) = b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09

You got flag :)

Possible exploit :
You steal admin cookie so you can get his access privileges on the site

How to prevent this:
You need to obfuscate what you store client-side, why not by crypting your data ?
