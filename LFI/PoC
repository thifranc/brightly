from: http://10.11.200.246/?page=media&src=nsa

you see src=[param], hmmm that looks interesting

you start by trying strange chars, lucky you, they aren't sanitized !

you understand that you got an LFI (Local File Inclusion)

Surely, the website behind does smthg like fopen($GET['src']) (in more complex, as the file included is not directly the name of the file :
for example : nsa leads to -> nsa_prism.jpg)

You start to look for docs -> google "LFI php exploit"
You get this doc : https://blog.clever-age.com/fr/2014/10/21/owasp-local-remote-file-inclusion-lfi-rfi/

Bad news, many are file path to guess
Good news, one seems to allow code executions : with data wrapper

You go to doc : http://php.net/manual/fr/wrappers.data.php

You start to see you can pass html formatted data
You send it with a <script> inside

You got flag

Possible exploit :
You can forge url with any JS script inside, allowing cookie steal for example

How to prevent this :
test that path you give to fopen are path you have on your server
