As you can see in the title you can only put 10 characters max.
You can bypass it by using a curl command, so first just inspect the page and go to network. Leave a feedback,
as you noticed there is a request called ?page=feedback. Copy it as curl and now in the title value you can put
whatever you want. Try something like <script>alert("darkly")</script>.
And now you got your flag.

How to fix it ?

You can easily fix it, you just need to escape the value received.
( for exemple the function filter_var() in PHP )
And instead of just putting characters max to 10, In the code crop the string and
keep the 10 first characters.
